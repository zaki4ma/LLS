## Project Overview

This is a roguelike game project. The codebase is currently empty and ready for initial development.

## Development Setup

No build system or dependencies have been configured yet. Common setup patterns for roguelike games include:
- Python with pygame, curses, or similar libraries
- JavaScript/TypeScript with web-based rendering
- C/C++ with ncurses or similar terminal libraries
- Rust with crossterm or similar crates
- Go with termui or similar packages

## Next Steps

The project appears to be in initial setup phase. Consider:
1. Choose a programming language and framework
2. Set up basic project structure
3. Initialize version control with `git init`
4. Add appropriate build/run scripts
5. Create initial game loop and display system

This file should be updated once the project structure and tooling are established.
